** To use it, you have to change your permission in the Database and Storage of the firebase.

Go to Firebase Console - Database - Rule. Change it this

```python
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```



And change the permission in Storage

Go to Firebase Console - Storage - Rules.

```python
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}

```

And To use notification, Please copy your firebase project server String to Model/const.dart file

Go to Firebase Console - Project settings - Cloud Messaging - Server key.

```python
const String firebaseCloudserverToken = 'YOUR_FB_SERVER_KEY';//AAAAFxtLywg:APA91bFbcXfhUI2b2MagqgYnL
const String firebaseCloudvapidKey = 'YOUR_VAPID_KEY';
const String youtubeChannelLink = 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLNCErWFQ6LZoaV_JKOq_lQ';

const chatInstruction = """Chat App is committed to maintaining a healthy chat, and blocks users who disseminated vegan chats or photos.
